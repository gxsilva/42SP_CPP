## Purpose

This repository is a consolidated reference of knowledge gained during the C++ modules at 42 SP. It serves as both a resource for future projects and a study aid for anyone learning C++.

## Disclaimer

These solutions and notes reflect my personal understanding and approach. Use them as a reference, but try to solve the exercises independently for the best learning experience.

| C 09   | Projects: Exchange, RPN calculator, Ford-Johnson algo  | 3         |

Each module builds on key C++ concepts, progressing from fundamentals to advanced topics and real-world projects.

## Compilation & Execution

A Makefile is provided with these rules:

| Command              | Description                                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `make` / `make all`  | Compile the project and generate the executable    |
| `make clean`         | Remove object files (`.o`), keep the executable    |
| `make fclean`        | Remove object files and the executable             |
| `make re`            | Clean and recompile the entire project             |

## Running the Program

```bash
./<executable_name>
```
Replace `<executable_name>` with the name of your compiled binary as defined in the Makefile.
