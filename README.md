# 42 SP C++ Exercises

This repository contains all the C++ exercises from the 42 Ecole, including bonus sections.

Alongside the completed exercises, you will also find personal notes and study materials on C++ concepts to support your learning journey.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a consolidated reference of knowledge acquired during the C++ modules at 42 SP. It is intended both as a resource for future projects and as study material for anyone interested in learning C++.

## Disclaimer

These solutions and notes reflect my personal understanding and approach to the projects. Feel free to use them as a reference, but I encourage you to attempt the exercises independently for the best learning experience.

Each module focuses on key C++ concepts, gradually building up from foundational topics to advanced programming techniques and real-world projects.

## Compilation & Execution

This project uses a Makefile with the following rules:

| Command         | Description                                             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `make` or `make all` | Compiles the project and generates the executable.     |
| `make clean`    | Removes all object files (`.o`), keeping the executable. |
| `make fclean`   | Removes all object files and the executable.               |
| `make re`       | Cleans and recompiles the entire project.                  |

## Running the Program
```bash
./<executable_name>
```
Replace <executable_name> with the name of your compiled binary (as defined in the Makefile).
